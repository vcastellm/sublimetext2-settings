# My Sublime Text 2 settings

These are the settings I use.  There are no dependencies right now.

## Install

Go to your Packages directory

	cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/


Clone this like so:

	git clone https://github.com/kelredd/sublime-text-2-user-settings.git User


Enjoy!

## Warning

I modify these at will without notice so things might get broken.  Use accordingly and don't blame me when stuff breaks.  It's probably better to fork or make copy of these to another location and just copy the parts you find most useful.

## Contributing

Feel free to submit any pull requests suggesting cool new settings or things I may not be aware of.

Please don't submit anything to the issues tracker - I most likely will ignore it.
